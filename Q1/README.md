## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Part A: I knew I had to use both methods, and also needed to compare and update
- Part B: I knew I needed to loop from start hour to end hour and needed to call walkDogs to update. Also, the bonus needed to be added conditionally 
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- The code was the same as during the exam, but with some fixes to errors.
- Errors include forgetting company. front of the methods.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- calling Methods
- If statements
- Boolean, and/or
- loops
- Instances
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Learn there were easier approaches like using Math.min, but overall, learn I need to be more careful and not forget Instances.
