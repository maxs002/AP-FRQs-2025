## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Easy to understand
- needed 2 private instance variables
- getSignature and addSignature methods
- I knew we had to add the input string parameter somewhere
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- Everything was the same, but the checking if the input string parameter was found.
- Corrected the addSignature conditions with the placement of the input string
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Class design
- String
- Conditions
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Always make sure the conditions is logical
