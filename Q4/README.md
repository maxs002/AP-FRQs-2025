## Question 3 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Easy to understand
- knew i needed to create new instance 
- I knew mod was needed
- although i need what was needed was kinda hard to write it during the test like the size()-1-i
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- made sure it was size()-1-i
- probably shouldve made variables for size() because too much writing
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- loops
- Mod
- ArrayList
- Arrays
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Always try to formulate a solution on paper before writing because questions like this can seem easy, but it contains a lot of info which can be overwhelming during test.
