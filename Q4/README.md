## Question 4 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Array):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Easy to understand
- Knew we need to check condtions of same path
- Booleans/if conditions
- did the same thing but i believe incorrectly did the first if condition of != row != col
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- made sure all if conditions were logical
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- loops
- Random Number generator
- if conditions/booleans
- Arrays
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Always try to formulate a solution on paper before writing because questions like this can seem easy, but it contains a lot of info which can be overwhelming during test.
