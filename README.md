# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Max Shi*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

My preparation strategy for the exam included doing all of the provided College Board MCQS, Watching Charlie's video, and using Codingbat to refresh.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were understanding the question.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me if you dont understand the question for more than 1-2 minutes flag it and come back later.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions be quick to point out obvious wrong answers on MCQs.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Deepening understanding of array: Some FRQs involved complex 2D array traversal, which I want to practice more.
- Improving code clarity: Some questions if you were to store the value in a variable would've stay time, and made it easier to understand.
- Strengthening recursion: So much of this on this year's test. This topic took so much of my time.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- [Passion Fruit](https://www.passionfruitlearning.com/) => is paid but you can use for free for a bit
- [AP CENTRAL](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions) => Past AP Exams. Bit different this year a lot more of recurison, and past years seems more straightforward.
- [CS AWESOME](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html) => When you don't understand a concept reading this 99% of the time makes it so you will understand it

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- [I like robotics, so I wanna make sure I can program my creation well]
- [Maybe one day I can make a web that helps with AP CSA Prep]
- [Read more. 5 pages for question 1 was crazy]
